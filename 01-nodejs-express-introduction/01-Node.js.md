## What is Node.js?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. It uses Google's V8 engine and is designed for building scalable network applications.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Server-side JavaScript**: Run JS on your computer/server
- **Event-driven**: Handles multiple operations without waiting
- **Non-blocking**: Doesn't stop for I/O operations
- **Single-threaded**: Uses one main thread with background workers
